# BGCAssetTracker
This Web based project has many features revolving around managing equipment across various areas such as local inventory as well as other locations 
of the BGC engineering inc.

Project Abstract

The BGC Equipment Tracker will be a web application used to help manage the BGC equipment inventory across three locations (Vancouver, Toronto, and Quebec). 
Our application is going to strive for user-end simplicity, allowing for the user to focus on their job rather than learning a complicated program. 
The BGC Equipment tracker will allow for Equipment Managers to scan the barcode of an item being lent out to a user, track which users have what equipment, 
as well as allowing them to view and request the equipment stored at the other locations. The Equipment Managers will also be able to look up specific users 
and see what they currently have signed out. When the user is done using their equipment, they can hand it back to the equipment manager, who will subsequently 
scan the equipment to sign it back into the inventory. The app will then automatically remove the equipment ID from the user's profile and update its status in 
the inventory. Equipment Managers will also be able to add, edit, and delete equipment entries. There will also be Admin users who have all the same abilities 
as the Equipment Managers, but they will also be able to create, edit, and delete user accounts.


Customer

Our customer is BGC Engineering. They are an international consulting firm that applies professional services in the applied earth sciences. 
Currently they’re using a generic app. Their current solution does not allow them to organise their equipment by the various locations (Vancouver, Toronto, and Quebec),
and it does not have a way for users to request equipment that is stored at different locations. By having an in-app feature to request equipment, 
this can speed up workflow and users can see the status of their request (pending, approved, denied).


Competitive Analysis

The new BGC Equipment Tracker will be a superior version of their current app. It will have the same inventory management functionality, however we will 
improve on the shortcomings they have addressed in their old app. The BGC Tracker will allow for users with visual impairments to have 
an easier time navigating the BGC Tracker due to it having a simple layout with large text and bold buttons on it’s interface. We will also allow for the
equipment database to be organised by different locations. Our option will also have other novel features such as Equipment Managers being able to generate ‘in-app’ 
requests for equipment at another location.
